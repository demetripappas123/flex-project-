Quick Website Project for Flexbox Skills 

This is a project meant to implement foundational flexbox, css, and html skills by emulating a webpage display from scratch. 
Some notes, goals, and insights may be listed below. 


Notes: 
text blocks automatically asume the width of the content, not the flex container 
flex containers, if h/w not specified, will assume the h/w of their content (on the cross axis)
borders need to have "solid" on them to show up 
border-radius to round corners 
pay attention to basic css rules
